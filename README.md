# RPA_Bank_Processing
RPA functioning UiPath application to process bank credit card application process

A prototype of a functioning RPA unattended (no contact with people) bot using UiPath Studio.
The bot processes the fictional bank's credit card applications and decides whether to accept the application or deny it
based on the personnel information excel sheet.

This project works with having UiPath Studion installed in your own device to run the application.
The project will start with viewing an HTML webpage for the fictional bank website asking for the applications folder from your device.
After obtaining the applications' folder location, the bot starts to process all applications found at the background with no human contact.
Shortly, you will find all results found in the folder location with new folders created dividing the accepted and denied applications.
